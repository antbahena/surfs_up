# Surfs Up

## Project Overview
In this challenge we are taking 

## Overview of the statistical analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to find the data for June temperatures and December temperatures. In order to do so I need to incorporate sqlalchemy in order to import the data into two data frames. One for each month.


## Results
1. Temperature is consistently surfable in June. As the mean is 74.94 degrees compared to December's 71.04 degrees. While this 3 degree difference may not mean much at first glance if we look at the low we can see that June is at 64 degrees compared to December where it is at 56 degrees. This means that there is a chance it will be 10 degrees colder which is not ideal surf weather.
